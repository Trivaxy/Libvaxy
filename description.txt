Libvaxy is a general utility mod that aims at speeding up development, and eliminating repetitive boilerplate code, getting things done faster and opening up new possibilities for you.

Here's an overview of what Libvaxy currently provides:
- Easy runtime reflection with automatic caching, so you don't have to do it yourself
- A ModAnalyzer class to retrieve a mod's resources without hassle (items, projectiles, globalnpcs, backgrounds, etc)
- Manipulating and creating textures at runtime, with automatic cleaning up
- The ability to turn tiles into falling tiles, without any extra work done on your part
- Various attributes that ease hooking and detouring methods both Terraria and other mods
- A handful of WorldGen utilities, along with the popular FastNoise library
- Classes that allow you to add content quicker (SimpleItem, SimpleTileItem, etc)
- AutoSerializers so saving/loading custom data is easier
- Debugging utilities for IL edits
- The ability to access non-public/hidden fields and methods without earning any slowdown from reflection
- Comes bundled with a safe version of the SharpMath2 library for all your collision needs

... and much more, coming soon, with your help!

Libvaxy is in an alpha 0.1 stage but relatively stable. You're free to use it in any shape or form (and we always welcome contributions on our github!)

Feedback on using this library is always welcome, you can find me on either the tModLoader discord, or my own discord in the homepage link.
